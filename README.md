## About the project
InnovateToEnable is a community of like-minded individuals who share the goal of creating impactful products for people with disabilities. Our aim is to bring together innovators from various backgrounds to collaborate and develop innovative solutions that can improve the lives of people with disabilities.


## Why Innovate for Disabilities
